Caesar Algorithm for Encryption and Decryption

* This is a small attempt to use Caesar algorithm to implement Encryption and Decryption of a String

* This thing is just shifting ASCII values of the characters to left or right by some digits

* The resultant will be a "Ciphertext" encrypted using "Caesar Algorithm"

How to run?

Just run the Python file using the syntax *python filename.py*

Enter the string you want to encypt. That's it :)

*Happy Coding*
